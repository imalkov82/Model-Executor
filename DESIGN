Application:
application has 3 components:

ENV SETUP:
1. folders creation
2. creation of data files

EXECUTION:
1. Pecube model:
    (a) Test,
    (b) Pecube
    (c) Vtk
2. Cascade model (not implemented)

ANALISYS:
4. Pecube model csv files (after manual creation):
    (a) age elevation profile
    (b) temperature profile

-------
FLOW:
-------
1. create folders tree: with data (input, data, bin, peout, VTK)
2. execute: Test, Pecube + Vtk
3. analyse the results:
    a. vtk module: create csv files
    b. statistics and graphs


TODO:
1. CONTERT TOPOGRAPHY FILE ($HOME/Documents/CODE/FORTRAN/Original Models/Cascade/cascade/cascade/RUN1) to VTK
    USE: code file createvtk.90 and see the lecture:
    (/home/imalkov/Videos/PROGRAMMING/PYTHON/Pluralsight - Python Beyond The Basics/08. Iterables and Iteration)
2. add analytical head solver to project. see reference file (~/DOCUMENTS/Future_Documents/GDRIVE_POST/Research/PyScripts/newpys/heatsol.py)
